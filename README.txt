# pirate_game - By Bob Tate

## Overview:

A game written in Python that allows a player to sail a pirate ship, fight sea battles, and plunder defeated enemy ships.

The code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/rtate7/pirate_game and will also be playable on PythonAnywhere.com. The game does not use any external services. Any device capable of running Python and writing to a command line can run the application. The code uses standard Python conventions, including snake case variable names and capitalized constant values. The code was written with an object oriented design to make the code easier to read and write. The game is "tunable" in that the difficulty of the game can be adjusted by making changes to the consant variable values in Constants.py.

To run the program, clone the GitHub repository to a local repository and run Main.py by entering the command: "python3 Main.py" on a device with version 3 of Python installed.
